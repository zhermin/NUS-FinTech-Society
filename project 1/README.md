# Project 1

Using ARIMA to Predict Close Prices from 2018 to 2020 of NUS Fintech Pte Ltd

---

## Description

By using ADF test to check for stationarity and PACF and ACF to find the AR(p) and MA(q) values, I apply a simple ARIMA model to try and predict 3 years into the future. Obviously, predicting so far ahead will give terrible results but that's part of the project requirements â€” just a familiarisation with some of these tools for time-series analysis.
